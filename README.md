# 🏏 **T20 International Score Predictor using Machine Learning** 🏆  

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
Cricket is a game full of surprises! 🏆 But what if we could **predict the score of a T20 match** based on live match conditions? 🤔 This project uses **Machine Learning (ML) models** to predict the **final score of a team** based on factors like **current runs, overs played, wickets fallen, run rate, and venue conditions**. 📊⚡  

## 🎯 **Objective**  
✅ Predict the **final score of a team** in a T20 International match.  
✅ Use **historical T20 match data** to train a machine learning model.  
✅ Help cricket analysts, fans, and betting platforms make **data-driven predictions**.  

## 📊 **Dataset Used**  
We use **historical T20 International match data**, which includes:  
🏏 **Batting Team** – The team currently batting.  
🌍 **Venue** – The stadium where the match is played.  
⏳ **Overs Played** – Number of overs completed.  
🦸 **Wickets Fallen** – Total wickets lost so far.  
🚀 **Current Score** – Runs scored at a given stage.  
📈 **Run Rate** – The current run rate.  
🎯 **Target Score** – If applicable in the 2nd innings.  

## 🏗 **Tech Stack**  
🧠 **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
📊 **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy.  
📈 **Feature Engineering:** Scikit-learn, One-Hot Encoding.  
📚 **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
🐍 **Programming Language:** Python.  

## 🔍 **How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Clean and prepare T20 match data.  
2️⃣ **Feature Selection** – Identify key factors affecting the final score.  
3️⃣ **Model Training** – Train models on past match data.  
4️⃣ **Prediction Phase** – Given live match stats, predict the **final score**.  
5️⃣ **Accuracy Evaluation** – Compare predictions with actual scores.  

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**  
✔️ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Measures prediction accuracy.  
✔️ **R² Score** – Evaluates how well the model fits the data.  

## 🛠 **Features**  
🏏 **Real-time Score Prediction** – Get instant score estimates.  
📊 **Multiple ML Models** – Compare models for best accuracy.  
🌍 **Venue-Based Adjustments** – Considers home/away conditions.  
🚀 **Impact of Wickets & Run Rate** – Predicts based on real-time match conditions.  

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**  
🔹 **Deep Learning Models (LSTMs)** for better time-series predictions.  
🔹 **Weather & Pitch Impact Analysis** for enhanced accuracy.  
🔹 **Live API Integration** to fetch real-time match data.  

## 🏁 **Conclusion**  
This project brings **data science into cricket**, making **T20 match score predictions more accurate and insightful!** 📊🔥 Whether you’re a **cricket fan, analyst, or developer**, this model helps you stay ahead of the game! 🏆🎯
